# Security considerations

## Sphinx

The [Sphinx](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/sphinx) prover is a fork of [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1)
and as such inherits a lot from its security design. The current release of Sphinx (`dev`) has backported all the
upstream security fixes as of SP1 `v1.0.8-testnet`. We will continue to update Sphinx with backports of upstream
security fixes and subsequent updates to both Sphinx and the Light Client, making them available as hotfixes.

In terms of Sphinx-specific changes that require special attention, here is a non-exhaustive list of Sphinx
AIR chips used for precompiles that are either not present in upstream SP1, or have had non-trivial changes:

- `Blake2sRoundChip`: Chip for the Blake2s hash function compression, as specified in [RFC 7693](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7693).
- `Sha512CompressChip`, `Sha512ExtendChip`: Chips for the SHA-512 hash function compression.

Notably, the Kadena light client does not use BLS12-381 related precompiles, such as field operations (`FieldAddChip`, `FieldSubChip`, `FieldMulChip`) or G1 decompression (`Bls12381G1DecompressChip`), neither does it use `Secp256k1DecompressChip`, a chip for decompressing K256 compressed points. Therefore, the light clientâ€™s proof does not depend on the correctness of these precompiles. 

There are also some SP1 chips and precompiles that are not present in Sphinx, such as `Uint256MulChip`.
