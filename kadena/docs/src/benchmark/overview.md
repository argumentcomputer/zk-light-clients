# Benchmark proving time

There are two types of benchmarks that can be used to get insight on the proving time necessary for each kind of proof
generated by the proof server. The first type will generate STARK core proofs, and represents the time it takes to
generate and prove execution of one of the programs. The second type will generate a SNARK proof that can be verified
on-chain, and represents the end-to-end time it takes to generate a proof that can be verified directly on-chain.
Due to the SNARK compression, the SNARK proofs take longer to generate and require more resources.

## GPU acceleration

Currently, the Sphinx prover is **CPU-only**, and there is no GPU acceleration integrated yet. We are working on
integrating future work for GPU acceleration as soon as we can to improve the overall proving time.

## Current Results

The current results are based on a list of Layer Block headers of 7 elements.
