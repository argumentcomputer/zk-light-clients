## On-chain Plonk verification

One of the requirements for the Light Client is the on-chain (Solidity) verification of Sphinx proofs generated by
epoch-change and inclusion programs.

For more information about how to run the on-chain verification benchmarks, please refer to the dedicated section of the
mdBook. Otherwise, the README can be found in the [`docs/src/benchmarks/on_chain.md`](../docs/src/benchmark/on_chain.md)
folder.

### Updating Wrapper contract

When Sphinx version is updated it is usually required to update and publish new correspondent version of
the [sphinx-contracts/solidity](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/sphinx-contracts/tree/main/solidity) dependency. 
Follow the [README](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/sphinx-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#smart-contracts-for-sphinx)
from the `sphinx-contracts` repository (if this is not done yet). Additionally, some updates are required in `solidity/contracts/test/test_lc_proofs.t.sol` source file,
specifically new hardcoded values from the fixtures are required. Those values can be obtained in a convenient form while
running [fixture-generator](https://github.com/argumentcomputer/zk-light-clients/tree/dev/fixture-generator) program, while
replacing JSON fixtures in `solidity/contracts/src/plonk_fixtures` path. Finally run:

```
cd kadena/solidity/contracts
forge update
```
