## End-to-end benchmarks

The end-to-end benchmark is meant to benchmark the time taken to send both of the proofs generation request to the Proof
Server, have a parallel computation happen and receive the two proofs back. This benchmark is meant to simulate the
worst case scenario where the client has to generate two proofs in parallel. It can run the proofs in sequence if the
benchmark is running in a single machine, to prevent resource exhaustion.

The benchmark can be found in
the [`proof-server`](https://github.com/lurk-lab/zk-light-clients/blob/dev/aptos/proof-server/benches/proof_server.rs)
crate. It can be run with the following command:

```bash
SHARD_BATCH_SIZE=0 RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native --cfg tokio_unstable -C opt-level=3" PRIMARY_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8080" SECONDARY_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8081" cargo bench --bench proof_server
```

This benchmark will spawn the two servers locally and make two requests in sequence to them. This generates both proofs
in the same machine, one after the other. In a production setting, the two prover servers will be in different machines,
and the two proofs would be generated in parallel. This returns times that are closer to a production setting, without
any resource exhaustion when generating the proofs.

To run the proofs in parallel even though it's running in one single machine, pass the `RUN_PARALLEL=1` environment variable
when running the benchmark. This is not recommended as the total reported time for generating both proofs at the same time
in the same machine will be longer than a properly configured production setting where the proofs are generated by different
machines.

The benchmark returns two main metrics for each proof:

- `e2e_proving_time`: Time in milliseconds taken to send both request to the Proof Server and generate both proofs.
- `inclusion_proof`:
    - `proving_time`: Time in milliseconds taken to generate the inclusion proof.
    - `request_response_proof_size`: Size of the proof in bytes returned by the server.
- `epoch_change_proof`:
    - `proving_time`: Time in milliseconds taken to generate the epoch change proof.
    - `request_response_proof_size`: Size of the proof in bytes returned by the server.

For our [production configuration](../run/overview.md), we currently get the following results:

```json
{
  "e2e_proving_time": 51489,
  "inclusion_proof": {
    "proving_time": 46636,
    "request_response_proof_size": 22830628
  },
  "epoch_change_proof": {
    "proving_time": 51489,
    "request_response_proof_size": 25482668
  }
}
```

## SNARK proofs

To enable SNARK proving, just pass the environment variable `SNARK=1` when running:

```bash
SNARK=1 SHARD_BATCH_SIZE=0 RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native --cfg tokio_unstable -C opt-level=3" PRIMARY_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8080" SECONDARY_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8081" cargo bench --bench proof_server
```

For our [production configuration](../run/overview.md), we currently get the following results:

```json
{
  "e2e_proving_time": 694809,
  "inclusion_proof": {
    "proving_time": 689228,
    "request_response_proof_size": 18454
  },
  "epoch_change_proof": {
    "proving_time": 694809,
    "request_response_proof_size": 28661
  }
}
```
