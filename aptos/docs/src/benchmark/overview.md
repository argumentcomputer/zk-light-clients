# Benchmark proving time

There are two types of benchmarks that can be used to get insight on the proving time necessary for each kind of proof
generated by the proof server. The first type will generate STARK core proofs, and represents the time it takes to
generate and prove execution of one of the programs. The second type will generate a SNARK proof that can be verified
on-chain, and represents the end-to-end time it takes to generate a proof that can be verified directly on-chain.
Due to the SNARK compression, the SNARK proofs take longer to generate and require more resources.

The worst case latency (described [here](../design/edge_cases.md)) can be evaluated by running the end-to-end benchmark
for each of the two proofs, and looking at the maximum of the time it took to genereate each proof.
