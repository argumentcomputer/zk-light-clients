## On-chain Plonk verification

One of the requirements for the Light Client is the on-chain (Solidity) verification of Sphinx proofs generated by
epoch-change and inclusion programs.

For more information about how to run the on-chain verification benchmarks, please refer to the dedicated section of the
mdBook. Otherwise, the README can be found in the [`docs/src/benchmarks/on_chain.md`](../docs/src/benchmark/on_chain.md)
folder.
